   - **Multi-configuration Projects**: Matrix of configurations
   - **Folder**: Organize jobs hierarchically
   - **Multibranch Pipeline**: Automatically create pipelines for branches

#### Jenkins Pipeline:

Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. It provides a set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines as code.

1. **Pipeline Types**:
   - **Declarative Pipeline**: Simpler, more structured syntax
   - **Scripted Pipeline**: More flexible, Groovy-based syntax

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Pipeline**: User-defined model of a CD pipeline
   - **Node**: A machine capable of executing a Pipeline
   - **Stage**: A conceptually distinct subset of the Pipeline
   - **Step**: A single task within a stage

3. **Example Declarative Pipeline**:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                sh 'mvn clean compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                sh 'mvn deploy'
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline executed successfully!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline execution failed!'
        }
    }
}
```
