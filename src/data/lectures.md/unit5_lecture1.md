# Unit V: DevOps with Cloud

## Lecture 1: Deployment and Infrastructure Management

### 1. Liquibase

Liquibase is an open-source database schema change management solution that enables you to track, version, and deploy database changes. It helps teams manage database schema changes in a systematic, version-controlled manner, similar to how source code changes are managed.

#### Key Features of Liquibase:

1. **Database-Agnostic**:
   - Works with most major databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)
   - Same change scripts work across different database platforms
   - Abstracts database-specific syntax differences

2. **Changelog-Based**:
   - Changes are defined in changelog files
   - Support for XML, YAML, JSON, and SQL formats
   - Sequential execution of changes
   - Tracking of executed changes

3. **Version Control Integration**:
   - Changelogs can be stored in version control systems
   - Changes can be tracked alongside application code
   - Supports branching and merging of database changes
   - Facilitates collaboration among team members

4. **Rollback Support**:
   - Automatic rollback generation for many change types
   - Manual rollback instructions for complex changes
   - Point-in-time rollback capabilities
   - Testing of rollback scripts

5. **Contexts and Labels**:
   - Selective execution of changes based on environment
   - Tagging changes for specific purposes
   - Filtering changes during deployment
   - Environment-specific configurations

6. **Preconditions**:
   - Validate database state before applying changes
   - Ensure changes are applied in the correct environment
   - Prevent execution of changes that would fail
   - Custom precondition checks

7. **Change Types**:
   - Schema changes (tables, columns, indexes, etc.)
   - Reference data management
   - Stored procedures and functions
   - Views and triggers
   - Custom SQL execution

8. **Integration with DevOps Tools**:
   - Command-line interface for automation
   - Maven, Gradle, and Ant plugins
   - Jenkins, Bamboo, and other CI/CD tools
   - Docker and Kubernetes integration

#### How Liquibase Works:

1. **Tracking Database Changes**:
   - Liquibase maintains a tracking table in your database (DATABASECHANGELOG)
   - Each change is recorded with a unique identifier
   - Execution timestamp and author are tracked
   - MD5 sum of changes is stored to detect modifications

2. **Change Definition**:
   - Changes are defined in changelog files
   - Each change is wrapped in a "changeSet" element
   - ChangeSets are identified by id, author, and filename
   - Changes can be grouped into logical units

3. **Change Execution**:
   - Liquibase reads the changelog file
   - Compares changes with the tracking table
   - Executes only new or modified changes
   - Updates the tracking table after successful execution

4. **Locking Mechanism**:
   - Prevents concurrent executions
   - Uses a lock table in the database (DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK)
   - Ensures only one instance of Liquibase runs at a time
   - Handles lock timeouts and cleanup

#### Liquibase Changelog Structure:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<databaseChangeLog
    xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog
                        http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-4.3.xsd">

    <!-- Include other changelog files -->
    <include file="changelog-1.0.xml" relativeToChangelogFile="true"/>
    
    <!-- Define a change set -->
    <changeSet id="1" author="developer">
        <comment>Create users table</comment>
        <createTable tableName="users">
            <column name="id" type="int" autoIncrement="true">
                <constraints primaryKey="true" nullable="false"/>
            </column>
            <column name="username" type="varchar(50)">
                <constraints unique="true" nullable="false"/>
            </column>
            <column name="email" type="varchar(100)">
                <constraints unique="true" nullable="false"/>
            </column>
            <column name="created_at" type="datetime" defaultValueComputed="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP">
                <constraints nullable="false"/>
            </column>
        </createTable>
        
        <rollback>
            <dropTable tableName="users"/>
        </rollback>
    </changeSet>
    
    <changeSet id="2" author="developer">
        <comment>Add index on email column</comment>
        <createIndex indexName="idx_users_email" tableName="users">
            <column name="email"/>
        </createIndex>
    </changeSet>
    
    <changeSet id="3" author="developer" context="test">
        <comment>Insert test data</comment>
        <insert tableName="users">
            <column name="username" value="testuser"/>
            <column name="email" value="test@example.com"/>
        </insert>
    </changeSet>
</databaseChangeLog>

#### Puppet Language and Resources:

Puppet uses a declarative language to define resources and their desired state. Resources are the basic building blocks of Puppet manifests.

**Example Puppet Manifest**:

```puppet
# Install and configure Apache web server

# Install Apache package
package { 'apache2':
  ensure => installed,
}

# Create a custom homepage
file { '/var/www/html/index.html':
  ensure  => file,
  owner   => 'www-data',
  group   => 'www-data',
  mode    => '0644',
  content => template('mymodule/index.html.erb'),
  require => Package['apache2'],
  notify  => Service['apache2'],
}

# Ensure Apache service is running and enabled
service { 'apache2':
  ensure     => running,
  enable     => true,
  hasrestart => true,
  hasstatus  => true,
  require    => Package['apache2'],
}

# Open firewall port for HTTP
firewall { '100 allow http access':
  dport  => 80,
  proto  => tcp,
