   - Size metrics (lines of code, function points)
   - Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics)
   - Design metrics (coupling, cohesion)
   - Performance metrics (response time, throughput)
   - Reliability metrics (defect density, mean time between failures)

2. **Process Metrics**: Measure aspects of the development process.
   - Productivity metrics (function points per person-month)
   - Efficiency metrics (defect removal efficiency)
   - Effort metrics (person-hours per task)
   - Schedule metrics (milestone completion)
   - Quality control metrics (inspection effectiveness)

3. **Project Metrics**: Measure project characteristics and execution.
   - Resource metrics (staff, equipment, budget)
   - Schedule metrics (milestone tracking, earned value)
   - Risk metrics (number of identified risks, risk exposure)
   - Team metrics (team velocity, team satisfaction)

#### Key Software Quality Metrics:
