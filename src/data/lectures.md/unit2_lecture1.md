# Unit II: Software Requirements

## Lecture 1: Understanding Software Requirements

### 1. Introduction to Software Requirements

Software requirements are the description of features and functionalities of the target system. They convey the expectations of users from the software product. Requirements serve as the foundation for the entire software development process, guiding design, implementation, testing, and maintenance activities.

#### Importance of Requirements:

1. **Foundation for Design**: Requirements provide the basis for system design and architecture.
2. **Contractual Agreement**: They serve as a contract between stakeholders and development team.
3. **Planning Aid**: Help in estimating costs, schedules, and resources.
4. **Validation Criteria**: Provide criteria for system validation and acceptance.
5. **Change Management**: Serve as a baseline for managing changes.

#### Characteristics of Good Requirements:

1. **Complete**: All necessary information is provided.
2. **Correct**: Accurately represents the stakeholders' needs.
3. **Feasible**: Can be implemented within project constraints.
4. **Necessary**: Represents a feature that stakeholders need.
5. **Prioritized**: Assigned a priority level for implementation.
6. **Unambiguous**: Has only one interpretation.
7. **Verifiable**: Can be tested or verified.
8. **Consistent**: Does not contradict other requirements.
9. **Traceable**: Can be traced to its origin and to design elements.

### 2. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the behavior of the systemâ€”what the system should do. They define specific functions, tasks, or services that the system must perform.

#### Characteristics of Functional Requirements:

1. **Describe system behavior**: What the system should do in response to certain inputs.
2. **Specify inputs, outputs, and behaviors**: Define how the system processes inputs and produces outputs.
3. **Detail-oriented**: Often very specific about system functionality.
4. **User-focused**: Typically expressed from the user's perspective.

#### Examples of Functional Requirements:

1. "The system shall allow users to create a new account by providing email, password, and personal information."
2. "The system shall send a confirmation email when a user registers."
3. "The system shall validate that all required fields are filled before submitting a form."
4. "The system shall allow administrators to view all user accounts."
5. "The system shall generate a monthly report of all transactions."

#### Techniques for Capturing Functional Requirements:

1. **Use Cases**: Describe interactions between users and the system to achieve specific goals.
2. **User Stories**: Short, simple descriptions of features from the user's perspective.
3. **Scenarios**: Specific instances of use cases that describe a sequence of events.
4. **Process Flows**: Visual representations of system processes and workflows.
5. **State Diagrams**: Show how the system transitions between different states.

### 3. Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. They are often called quality attributes and describe how well the system performs its functions.

#### Categories of Non-functional Requirements:

1. **Performance Requirements**:
   - Response time
   - Throughput
   - Capacity
   - Scalability

2. **Reliability Requirements**:
   - Availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
   - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
   - Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
   - Failure rate

3. **Security Requirements**:
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Data integrity
   - Confidentiality
   - Non-repudiation

4. **Usability Requirements**:
   - Learnability
   - Efficiency
   - Memorability
   - Error prevention
   - User satisfaction

5. **Maintainability Requirements**:
   - Modularity
   - Reusability
   - Analyzability
   - Modifiability
   - Testability

6. **Portability Requirements**:
   - Adaptability
   - Installability
   - Replaceability
   - Compatibility

#### Examples of Non-functional Requirements:

1. "The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds under normal load conditions."
2. "The system shall be available 99.9% of the time during business hours."
3. "The system shall support at least 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation."
4. "The system shall be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers."
5. "The system shall comply with GDPR data protection regulations."

#### Challenges with Non-functional Requirements:

1. **Measurability**: Difficult to quantify and measure.
2. **Subjectivity**: Often subject to interpretation.
3. **Trade-offs**: Improving one quality attribute may negatively impact another.
4. **Testing**: Can be challenging to test and validate.
5. **Prioritization**: Difficult to prioritize among competing quality attributes.

### 4. User Requirements

User requirements are statements, in natural language or visual diagrams, that describe what services the system is expected to provide to system users and the constraints under which it must operate. They are written from the user's perspective and focus on the user's needs and goals.

#### Characteristics of User Requirements:

1. **High-level**: Describe general features and constraints.
2. **User-focused**: Written from the user's perspective.
3. **Natural language**: Expressed in everyday language.
4. **Minimal technical details**: Avoid implementation specifics.
5. **Goal-oriented**: Focus on what users want to achieve.

#### Formats for Documenting User Requirements:

1. **Natural Language Statements**: Simple statements describing what users need.
2. **User Stories**: "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."
3. **Use Case Diagrams**: Visual representation of user interactions with the system.
4. **Storyboards**: Visual sequences showing user interactions.
5. **Personas and Scenarios**: Fictional characters and narratives representing user types.

#### Examples of User Requirements:

1. "The online banking system should allow customers to view their account balances and transaction history."
2. "As a marketing manager, I want to generate reports on campaign performance so that I can evaluate effectiveness."
3. "The inventory management system should notify warehouse staff when stock levels are low."
4. "The mobile app should allow users to scan QR codes to access product information."
5. "The customer support portal should enable users to track the status of their support tickets."

#### Problems with User Requirements:

1. **Ambiguity**: Natural language can be interpreted in different ways.
2. **Incompleteness**: Users may not express all their needs.
3. **Inconsistency**: Different users may have conflicting requirements.
4. **Unrealistic expectations**: Users may request features that are not feasible.
5. **Volatility**: User needs may change over time.

### 5. System Requirements

System requirements are more detailed descriptions of the software system's functions, services, and operational constraints. They serve as a bridge between user requirements and software design, providing a more technical and precise specification of what the system should do.

#### Characteristics of System Requirements:

1. **Detailed**: Provide specific information about system functionality.
2. **Technical**: Include technical details and constraints.
3. **Precise**: Minimize ambiguity and vagueness.
4. **Structured**: Organized in a systematic way.
5. **Complete**: Cover all aspects of the system.

#### Types of System Requirements:

1. **Functional System Requirements**: Detailed descriptions of system functions and services.
2. **Non-functional System Requirements**: Detailed specifications of system properties and constraints.
3. **Domain Requirements**: Requirements derived from the application domain.
4. **Interface Requirements**: Specifications for how the system interacts with external entities.
5. **Operational Requirements**: Specifications for how the system will be operated and maintained.

#### Examples of System Requirements:

1. "The system shall authenticate users by verifying their username and password against the user database."
2. "The system shall encrypt all passwords using SHA-256 hashing algorithm before storing them in the database."
3. "The system shall log all failed login attempts, recording the username, timestamp, and IP address."
4. "The system shall automatically lock a user account after 5 consecutive failed login attempts."
5. "The system shall provide an API endpoint for retrieving user profile information in JSON format."

#### Relationship Between User and System Requirements:

User requirements are typically high-level statements that describe what the system should do from the user's perspective. System requirements elaborate on these, providing the technical details needed for implementation. For example:

- **User Requirement**: "Users should be able to search for products by name or category."
- **System Requirements**:
  - "The system shall provide a search box on every page of the website."
  - "The system shall allow users to filter search results by product category, price range, and brand."
  - "The system shall display search results within 1 second for queries returning fewer than 1000 products."
  - "The system shall implement full-text search using Elasticsearch."
